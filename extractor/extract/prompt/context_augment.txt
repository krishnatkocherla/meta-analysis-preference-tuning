Augment the extracted records from the table's LaTeX source by incorporating additional context from the text source to enrich and complete the records related to preference-based alignment methods.  
You must output only records associated with preference tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Implicit Preference Optimization (IPO), Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), Relative Preference Optimization (RPO), Generalized Preference Optimization (GPO), Iterative Reasoning Preference Optimization (IRPO), or other methods that directly optimize models based on human preferences.

‚ùó DO NOT extract or augment records that:
- Do not contain a valid preference-based tuning method.
- Use non-preference-based techniques like supervised fine-tuning or reward modeling without comparisons.
- Only use the model as an evaluator, generator, or judge without aligning it via preference signals.

If no preference tuning method is found, output that specific record as "<FAILED>" (do NOT set "pref_tuning_method": "xx").

==========================
Enrichment Instructions:
==========================

Use the following fields to augment extracted records. Search across the table LaTeX source, table caption, and source text to fill in as many fields as possible:

1. value:
   - Revisit the original table cell to ensure the numeric value is complete.
   - Ensure it's a valid performance result (e.g., win rate, accuracy, Elo).

2. metric:
   - Identify the evaluation metric associated with the numeric value (e.g., Accuracy, Elo, Win rate, MT-Bench score).

3. evaluation_method:
   - Specify the evaluation protocol (e.g., MT-Bench, GPT-4 judge, AlpacaEval, Human Eval).

4. benchmark_or_task:
   - The broader benchmark or challenge (e.g., MT-Bench, Arena-Hard, AlpacaEval, Open LLM Leaderboard).

5. dataset:
   - Full name of the dataset used in training or evaluation.

6. dataset_citation_tag:
   - If a citation is given (e.g., \cite{openai2023gpt4}), return only the tag name (e.g., openai2023gpt4), not LaTeX code.

7. subset:
   - Identify domains, categories, or subsets like Helpful, Harmless, Instruct, Coding, Reasoning.
   - Prefer subset inference from table column headers.

8. base_model:
   - Full name of the pretrained base model being aligned (e.g., LLaMA-2-7B, GPT-J, Mistral, Falcon-7B).

9. pref_tuning_method:
   - This must be a valid preference-based method (e.g., DPO, KTO, GPO, IPO).
   - If not found, output "<FAILED>".

10. hyperparameters:
    - Extract training settings such as learning rate, comparison temperature, batch size, reward shaping, number of comparisons.
    - Use a JSON-like string if multiple.

11. PEFT:
    - Parameter-efficient fine-tuning method if any (e.g., full-finetuning, LoRA, QLoRA, P-tuning).
    - If attached to tuning method (e.g., DPO-LoRA), split accordingly.

==========================
Output Format:
==========================

Only output filled templates as shown below (no LaTeX, no extra explanation). Output each augmented record separately.
If no valid preference tuning method is found, output:

<FAILED>

Otherwise, use this format:

{"value": "xx", "metric": "xx", "evaluation_method": "xx", "benchmark_or_task": "xx", "dataset": "xx", "dataset_citation_tag": "xx", "subset": "xx", "base_model": "xx", "pref_tuning_method": "xx", "hyperparameters": "xx", "PEFT": "xx"}
