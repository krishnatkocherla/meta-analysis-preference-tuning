Generate a description based on the provided dataset name and subset, leveraging text source. The description should adhere to the following structure:

**Dataset Summary**: Present a concise and high-level overview of the dataset. Include details such as its domain, intended tasks, key characteristics, and evaluation goals.  
**Task Explanation**: Provide a brief explanation of the task, specifying the input, output, and any accompanying instructions. Additionally, describe the task evaluation method.  
**Subset Description**: If the subset is specified (not "xx"), include a brief description of its content or purpose.  

Notes:
- If the dataset name is unclear, or ambiguous (e.g., synthetic data, human eval data), return "<FAILED>".  
- Return "<FAILED>" if a subset is specified (not "xx") but you cannot identify the subset information. 
- Do not make a guess during generation. If uncertain about the dataset name or subset, return "<FAILED>".
